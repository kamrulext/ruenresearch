Code**\n\n-   Install R [Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)\n\n-   Install Python [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n-   Install pip (package installer for python) using cmd (command prompt): `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`\n\n-   For python3, update pip if needed: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`\n\n-   Install Jupyter using cmd: `python -m pip install jupyter`\n\n-   You can also install Jupyter Lab using cmd: `python -m pip install jupyterlab`\n\n-   You can launch Jupyter Notebook or Lab using cmd: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter
