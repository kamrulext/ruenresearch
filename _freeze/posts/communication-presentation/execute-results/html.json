Concept\n2.  Types\n3.  Elements\n4.  Uses\n\n# Introduction {#introduction}\n\n**Did you know?**\n\n-   We spend around **70%** of our time in some form of communication (listening, speaking, reading, writing). Most researchers agree it's between **60%–80%**, with **listening** alone taking \\~45%.\n-   Communication and human relations skills are currencies in professional and personal life.\n\n# Importance of Communication\n\nEffective communication builds:\n\n-   Trust\n-   Cooperation\n-   Conflict resolution\n-   Teamwork and collaboration\n\n# Concept of Communication {#concept-of-communication}\n\n-   Communication is the **exchange of messages** between a **source** (sender) and a **receiver** (audience).\n-   It is not linear — it's **reciprocal and iterative**.\n-   It involves **feed-forward** (message sent) and **feedback** (message received).\n\n# ![](images/clipboard-355934778.png)\n\n# Flow of Communication\n\n-   Sender initiates message\\\n-   Receiver responds with feedback\\\n-   Shared understanding is the goal\n\nCommunication is complete only when mutual understanding is achieved.\n\n# Communication Cycle Example {#communication-cycle-example}\n\n``` text\nSender: \"Hello\" (Feed-forward)\nReceiver: \"Hi!\" (Feedback)\n```\n\nFeedback makes the process **interactive** and **meaningful**.\n\n# Communication: An Unusual Example {#communication-an-unusual-example}\n\nIf someone slaps a boy (Feed-forward), and the boy cries (Feedback), **is it communication?**\n\n> **Yes**, this is **non-verbal communication**.\n> Even in negative or chaotic situations, **messages are exchanged and feedback occurs**.\n\n# Chaotic or Silent Communication\n\nConflict, violence, or silence can also be forms of communication.\n\n> Even **no feedback** is a **form of feedback**.\n\nExample: A phone rings but no one answers — we assume they are unavailable.\n\n# Silence and Feedback {#silence-and-feedback}\n\nCalling someone who doesn’t respond — we interpret that as absence or disinterest.\\\nA **dead person** cannot provide feedback — this **ends the communication loop**.\n\n# Types of Communication {#types-of-communication}\n\n**Verbal Communication** (\\~30%): - Spoken or written words\n\n**Non-verbal Communication** (\\~70%): - Facial expressions - Gestures - Posture - Eye contact - Tone of voice\n\n# Models of Communication {#models-of-communication}\n\n1.  **Linear Model** – One-way transmission (e.g., TV broadcast)\n\n2.  **Interactive Model** – Sender ↔ Receiver with feedback (e.g. News blog)\n\n3.  **Transactional Model** – Both parties simultaneously sender and receiver (e.g. Interview)\n\n# Transactional Communication\n\nModern communication favors **transactional**, real-time exchange — especially in interpersonal and professional settings.\n\n# Feedback in Communication {#feedback-in-communication}\n\nFeedback can be: - **Intentional** (e.g., nodding to show understanding) - **Unintentional** (e.g., yawning from boredom)\n\n# Feedback Examples\n\n-   A student raising hand = intentional\n-   Looking distracted = unintentional\n\nFeedback helps the sender adjust or clarify the message.\n\n# Effective Comm^n^\n\n1.  **Source credibility** – Trustworthiness, expertise\n2.  **Audience characteristics** – Age, education, values, needs\n3.  **Channel availability** – Face-to-face, phone, email\n4.  **Feedback mechanism** – Immediate or delayed, verbal or non-verbal\n5.  **Message treatment** – Tailoring the message improves effectiveness.\n\n# Message Organization\n\n-   Organize your message logically:\n-   Simple to complex\n-   General to specific\n-   Chronological (time-based)\n-   Topical (theme-based)\n\n# Message Appeals\n\nUse persuasive appeals:\n\n-   **Fear appeal**: Warns about negative consequences\n-   **Reward appeal**: Shows benefits of action\n-   **Emotional appeal**: Connects with feelings like love, guilt, pride\n-   **Rational appeal**: Based on logic, facts, reasoning\n\n# Channel {#selecting-the-right-communication-channel}\n\nDepends on:\n\n**Urgency**: Quick response?\n→ Phone or face-to-face\n\n**Message complexity**: Complex info → Written or visual aids\n\n-   **Audience access**: Choose accessible medium\n-   **Formality**:\\\n    → Formal = Email or letter\\\n    → Informal = Chat or call\n\nChoose wisely to improve clarity and impact.\n\n# Communication & Human Relations\n\nCommunication builds **human relationships** through:\n\n-   Persuasion\n-   Negotiation\n-   Diplomacy\n-   Dispute resolution\n\n# Empathy in Communication\n\n> The key is **empathy** – seeing from the other’s perspective.\n\nBuilds trust and strengthens understanding.\n\n# Persuasive Communication {#persuasive-communication-techniques}\n\n-   **Empathy**: Put yourself in others’ shoes\n-   **Clarity**: Use clear, precise language\n-   **Relevance**: Match audience interest\n-   **Respect**: Be polite and culturally sensitive\n\n# Communication for Journalist {#communication-for-reporters}\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\nReporters deal with **exceptional cases** (outliers).\nThey must ensure:\n\n-   Accurate communication of facts\n-   Sensitivity in presentation\n-   Ethical standards\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\nRight column\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](communication-presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::::\n\n\n# Reporting and Unusual Events\n\n> Usual things don’t make headlines — unusual does!\n\nReporters must balance drama and truth.\n\n# Objectivity & Subjectivity\n\n-   **Objective**: Facts, data, neutrality\n-   **Subjective**: Emotions, experience, opinion\n-   **Important vs Urgent**: Don't miss the important ones becuase of many other urgent issues.\n\n> Good communication blends all thoughtfully.\n\n# Avoid Biases in Communication\n\n-   Avoid **prejudices** and **bias**\n-   Don’t rely only on past experience\n-   Incorporate **latest and accurate information**\n\n# Summary {#summary}\n\n-   Communication is central to **human interaction**\n-   It's a **two-way**, dynamic, and **context-sensitive** process\n-   Mastering communication enhances **relationships**, **influence**, and **understanding**\n\n# Thank You!\n\n> Any Questions?\\\n> Let’s continue the discussion.\n",
